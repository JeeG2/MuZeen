                                concerning the performance of a funeral ceremony. The sculptural apparatus represents a scene of 
                                funeral procession organized on two compositional registers which, in reality, have the purpose of 
                                giving depth and three-dimensionality to the representation. The characters present on the stone slab 
                                are numerous, but identifiable in their tasks: starting from the left, above, the praeficae are visible, 
                                specially paid women to artfully demonstrate the pain, singing songs in honor of the deceased; on the lower 
                                level eight men (lecticarii) are evident, supporting the coffin, anticipated by the dissignator, who directs 
                                the ceremony. </p>

                            <p class="lead">It thundered so much that it rained. In the end, as expected, the second test of the 2017 high 
                                school diploma in classical high school saw the "release" of a version to be translated by Lucio Anneo Seneca , 
                                the great philosopher and scholar of antiquity who, with Cicero and Tacitus, is always one of the most hoped 
                                for by young Italian graduates for the relative simplicity of his prose. The version that, in these hours, 
                                the students are translating at school desks is an excerpt from the famous "Letters to Lucilius", entitled 
                                " The value of philosophy". Some passages of this passage represent a real homage to philosophy, understood 
                                not only as a discipline but as a life practice, typical of the stoicism practiced by Seneca. </p>

                            <p class="lead">This is the third close burgonet helmet found by Jamestown Rediscovery archaeologists. Introduced 
                                in the early 16th century, the close burgonet helmet was designed to provide full head and face protection 
                                while at the same time evoking classical military authority. In Europe, this type of helmet was mostly worn 
                                by cavalry. There was no cavalry in early Jamestown, so the helmet was modified to make it useful. These 
                                fragments of the helmet, the visor and chin protection element collectively known as a bevor, were found in 
                                a James Fort cellar that was filled with trash c. 1617. Removal of these components from the skull piece of 
                                the burgonet sacrificed some protection but enabled a colonist to wear the skull piece alone as a lighter 
                                helmet with greater visibility and flexibility. The skull piece that belongs to this cabasset helmet has not 
                                yet been recovered. These parts of the helmet were found discarded in an open position, and although the helmet 
                                has undergone extensive conservation, the artifact is concreted so that the hinges on the sides no longer 
                                operate. However, the visor and chin protection element's original form has been reconstructed digitally, 
                                see below for image.

                                    resting on two small columns. Above a marble throne covered with a canopy of red festoons alternated 
                                    with white coat of arms with a black eagle, is the Virgin wrapped in a large dark mantle with a gold 
                                    border, above a brown robe. On either side of the throne, two praying Angels, dressed one with a large 
                                    pink robe, the other green, are facing the naked Child in the Virgin's arms, with three little flowers 
                                    in hand. On the supper of the throne in Latin capitals: AVE. QUEEN. CELORUM. AVE. DOMUS. The painting 
                                    was unanimously attributed by critics to Saturnino Gatti for affinity with the Madonna del Rosario from 
                                    the Aquilana church of San Domenico, noting in the breadth of the forms a Pierfrancescan ancestry mediated 
                                    through Antoniazzo Romano. The Serra also highlighted numerous references to Fiorenzo di Lorenzo in the 
                                    brightness of the forms and in the modulation of the drapery. </p>
